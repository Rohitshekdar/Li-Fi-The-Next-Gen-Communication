# Li-Fi-the-next-gen-communication
Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) is a rapidly growing technology where transmission rates has reached in gigabytes and bandwidth has increased moreover the data security is maintained since the data transmission is through light so if light does'nt pass through the walls the network cannot be hacked unlike Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi possess various security threats which can be solved using Lifi as the range is limited which reduces this problem.
It it simple to design the model as it involves only the transmitter and reciever with proper line of sight (LOS).
