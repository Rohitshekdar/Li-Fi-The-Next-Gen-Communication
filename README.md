# Li-Fi-the-next-gen-communication
Light Fidelity (Li-Fi) is a rapidly growing technology where transmission rates has reached in gigabytes and bandwidth has increased moreover the data security is maintained since the data transmission is through light so if light does'nt pass through the walls the network cannot be hacked unlike Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi possess various security threats which can be solved using Lifi as the range is limited which reduces this problem.
It it simple to design the model as it involves only the transmitter and reciever with proper line of sight (LOS).


## Overview  
This repository demonstrates a **Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) system** designed for **audio transmission** using visible light. Li-Fi is a revolutionary wireless communication technology that uses light waves for data transfer, offering high transmission rates, enhanced security, and immunity to radio frequency interference. This project implements a simple Li-Fi model for transmitting audio signals from a **transmitter** to a **receiver** through a visible light medium.  

## Features  
- **Secure Data Transmission:**  
  - Light-based transmission ensures data security as light cannot pass through walls, reducing the risk of hacking compared to Wi-Fi.  
- **Simple Hardware Design:**  
  - Only a transmitter, a light source (e.g., LED), and a receiver with a photodiode are required.  
- **Line-of-Sight (LOS) Communication:**  
  - Ensures reliable and interference-free audio signal transmission.  
- **Real-Time Audio Transmission:**  
  - Transmits and plays audio in real-time without significant delays.  

## Workflow  
1. **Audio Signal Input:** Capture an audio signal using a microphone or an external source.  
2. **Modulation:** Modulate the audio signal into a light intensity signal using the transmitter circuit.  
3. **Transmission:** Transmit the modulated light signal using an LED.  
4. **Reception:** Detect the transmitted light signal using a photodiode.  
5. **Demodulation:** Convert the received light signal back into an audio signal using the receiver circuit.  
6. **Output:** Play the demodulated audio through a speaker or headphones.  

## Applications  
- **Secure Communication:** Ideal for environments requiring secure data transmission, such as military and confidential offices.  
- **Wireless Audio Systems:** Transmit audio wirelessly in homes, offices, or conference rooms.  
- **IoT Devices:** Integrate with IoT for light-based communication.  
- **Underwater Communication:** Li-Fi is effective where radio frequencies fail, such as underwater.  

## Requirements  
- **Hardware:**  
  - LED for light transmission  
  - Photodiode for light reception  
  - Transistor, resistors, and capacitors for modulation/demodulation  
  - Speaker or headphones for audio output  
  - Power supply for the circuits  

- **Software:**  
  - Signal processing software (optional, for advanced features)  
  - Audio source (e.g., smartphone, computer)
